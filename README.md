# ðŸŒ³ @akb2/three-tree-geometry

A lightweight procedural **tree geometry generator** for [Three.js](https://threejs.org), written in TypeScript. It creates realistic, branching 3D tree structures using custom geometry based on configurable parameters.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @akb2/three-tree-geometry
```

## Overview

`@akb2/three-tree-geometry` provides a procedural tree mesh generator built on top of `THREE.BufferGeometry`. It constructs a complete 3D tree â€” including branches, segments, and UV-mapped faces â€” ready for rendering or further manipulation in Three.js.

The library is part of the [`@akb2` toolset](https://www.npmjs.com/org/akb2), and integrates well with:

* [`@akb2/math`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@akb2/math)
* [`@akb2/types-tools`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@akb2/types-tools)

## Usage Example

```ts
import { MeshStandardMaterial, Mesh } from "three";
import { TreeGeometry } from "@akb2/three-tree-geometry";

// Define geometry parameters
const params = {
  generations: 5,
  length: 2.5,
  uvLength: 2,
  radius: 0.15,
  radiusSegments: 8,
  heightSegments: 5
};

// Create tree geometry and mesh
const geometry = new TreeGeometry(params);
const material = new MeshStandardMaterial({ color: 0x8B4513 });
const tree = new Mesh(geometry, material);

// Add to scene
scene.add(tree);
```

### Properties

| Property              | Type        | Description                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `branchesEnds`        | `Vector3[]` | Endpoints of all generated branches           |
| `positionsOfBranches` | `Vector3[]` | Cached list of averaged points along branches |
| `type`                | `string`    | Always `"TreeGeometry"`                       |

---

### Methods

#### `getPositionsOfBranches(skip?: number): Vector3[]`

Returns all branch points (center positions of each segment), sorted by Y coordinate.
Optional `skip` parameter allows skipping the first *n* points.

---

#### `clone(): this`

Creates a deep copy of the geometry, including its parameters and computed branches.

#### `copy(source: this): this`

Copies geometry data and parameters from another `TreeGeometry` instance.

---

### Internal Methods (for advanced use)

These are used internally but can be overridden for custom generation:

* `buildBranches(branch: TreeBranch, offset?: number): BuildData`
* `buildBranch(branch: TreeBranch, offset?: number): BuildData`

Both methods construct vertices, faces, and UVs for each branch and its children recursively.
